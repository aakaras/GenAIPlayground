             <p>
                 At AI Playground, we're committed to protecting your privacy. We understand that your data is important to you, and we want to be transparent about how we collect, use, and safeguard it. This Privacy Policy explains our practices in clear and simple language.
             </p>

             <h2>What We Collect (and Don't!)</h2>

             <p>
                 We collect the minimum amount of information necessary to provide you with our services. Here's a breakdown:
             </p>

             <h3>Information You Provide:</h3>
             <ul>
                 <li>
                     <strong>Creative Prompts:</strong> When you use our chat or image generation features, you provide us with text prompts to spark your imagination. 
                 </li>
             </ul>

             <h3>What We Steer Clear Of:</h3>
             <ul>
                 <li>
                     <strong>Personal Details:</strong>  We don't collect your name, email address, or any other information that could personally identify you.
                 </li>
             </ul>

             <h2>How Your Input Fuels the Magic</h2>

             <p>
                 Your prompts are the key to unlocking creative possibilities. Here's how we use them:
             </p>
             <ul>
                 <li>
                     <strong>Making the Magic Happen:</strong> We share your prompts with trusted AI partners like Azure OpenAI to generate the responses and images you request.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     <strong>Constant Improvement:</strong> We might analyze anonymized and aggregated prompt data to fine-tune our application's performance and make it even better.
                 </li>
             </ul>

             <h2>Your Data's Short Journey</h2>

             <p>
                 We believe in data minimalism. <strong>We don't store any of the prompts you submit.</strong> Once a prompt has served its purpose and generated your desired output, it vanishes from our system.
             </p>

             <h2>Teaming Up for Creativity</h2>

             <p>
                 We collaborate with awesome AI services like Azure OpenAI to power our creative features. They have their own privacy policies, which you can find here:
             </p>

             <ul>
                 <li>
                     <strong>Azure OpenAI:</strong> <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy?tabs=azure-portal" target="_blank">[Link to Azure OpenAI Privacy Policy]</a>
                 </li>
             </ul>

             <p>
                 While we trust our partners, we want to be clear that their data practices are their own. 
             </p>

             <h2>Your Privacy, Your Call</h2>

             <p>
                 Using our application means you're cool with how we handle your data. If you have any concerns, you're always welcome to opt out and explore other creative avenues.
             </p>

             <h2>Keeping Young Minds Safe</h2>

             <p>
                 Our application is designed for adults and creative minds aged 13 and above. We don't knowingly collect information from younger users. If you believe a child has provided us with their information, please reach out – we're here to help.
             </p>

             <h2>Evolving with the Times</h2>

             <p>
                 Privacy is an ongoing conversation, and we may update this policy as needed. We'll always keep you in the loop by posting any changes right here. 
             </p>
